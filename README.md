    TEAM PLAYERS presents

    << FrootyBooty >>
    A 72 HOUR GDC game

    ***

    GAMEPLAY
    --------

    The object of the game is to keep your life meter up by eating tasty
    fruit and avoiding rotten fruit, but watch out - for every 10 fruits
    you eat your level will increase, causing the fruit to fall faster!

    Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player from side to
    side and the up arrow to make him chomp. Tip: You can keep his mouth
    open by holding down the up arrow key.

    Eating tasty fruit will increase your score by up to 25 points and
    your life by up to 10%. Rotten fruit, on the other hand, will decrease
    your life by half and your score by 25. Tip: Larger fruits are worth
    more points and give you more life.
